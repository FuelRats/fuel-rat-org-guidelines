# Tech Rat Code Standards and Guidelines
Here you will find rules we expect all contributing developers to follow, regardless of who they are. Any PR not following these rules will be denied. No exceptions!

# The Rules
### Rule 1: NO SINGLE CHAR LENGTH VARIABLES
### Rule 2: _"Don't be an asshat."_ -DerryBear
### Rule 3: If one exists, read and follow the associated language.md file, located in this repo, for the project you are contributing to
### Rule 4: If one exists, read and follow the CONTRIBUTING.md of the repository you're contributing to.


Our minimum language requirements are listed in the associated LANGUAGE.md files, these rules apply unless 
they are **explicitly** overwritten by the project's CONTRIBUTING.md
