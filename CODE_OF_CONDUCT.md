# Fuel Rats Contributor Code of Conduct

Please read through this document and understand the specifics.  If you do not, feel free to ask another contributor, or contact a member of the Moderation team.

This policy is in place to establish behavioral expectations and guidelines to ensure an open, tolerant, and professional environment for all participants.  We believe anyone participating in our projects deserve a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, caste, gender, gender identity or expression, culture ethnicity, disability, language, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or technical ability.  Discrimination based on any of these protected characteristics will not be tolerated.

This policy is NOT intended to supersede the Fuel Rats [Terms of Service](https://fuelrats.com/terms-of-service), but as a supplement to cover non-rescue contributions.

## Standards

We hope all members strive to go beyond examples laid out here and actively create a positive and respectful atmosphere.

* **Foster a friendly, judgement-free environment for all.**  This project houses international contributors from all walks of life, with varying experience.
* **Keep an open-mind, and respect differing viewpoints.** Lest we forget the professional attitude best displayed in our work.
* **Be professional and considerate.** Discuss and resolve conflicts in an open, civil manner.  Disagreements are inevitable.
* **Show patience and be helpful.**  We all make mistakes.  Playing the 'blame game' helps no one.

#### Negative Behavior Examples

* Forcing others to participate
* Public or private harassment
* Trolling/Personal attacks
* 'Doxxing' or making a person's private information available without explicit permission
* Conduct considered inappropriate for a professional environment.
* Conduct considered unbecoming by any member of the 'Tech Rat Moderation' team.
