# Fuel Rats Contributor Code of Conduct

Please read through this document and make sure you understand the specifics.  If you have questions or are unclear about something, feel free to contact a member of the Moderation team.

This policy is in place to establish behavioral expectations and guidelines to ensure an open, tolerant, and professional environment for all participants.  We believe anyone participating in our projects deserve a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, caste, gender, gender identity or expression, culture ethnicity, disability, language, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or technical ability.  Discrimination based on any of these protected characteristics will not be tolerated.

## Standards

We hope all members strive to go beyond examples laid out here and actively create a positive and respectful atmosphere.

* **Foster a friendly, judgement-free environment for all.**  This project houses international contributors from all walks of life, with varying experience.
* **Respect differing viewpoints.** Lest we forget the professional attitude best displayed in our work.
* **Be professional and considerate.** Discuss and resolve conflicts in an open, civil manner.  Disagreements are inevitable.
* **Show patience and be helpful.**  We all make mistakes.  Playing the 'blame game' helps no one.

#### Negative Behavior Examples

These examples should not be considered an exhaustive list.  This code of conduct establishes the parameters of expected conduct, and contributors or contributions that fall outside that spirit are not welcome.

* Discriminatory behavior
* Forcing others to participate
* Public or private harassment
* Trolling/Personal attacks
* 'Doxxing' or making a person's private information available without explicit permission
* Conduct considered inappropriate for a professional environment.
